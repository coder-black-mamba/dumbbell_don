- `uv` package manager (`pip install uv`)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd dumbbell_don
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
    This project uses `uv` for package management.
    ```bash
    uv venv
    uv sync
    ```
    This will create a `.venv` directory and install all the packages listed in `pyproject.toml`.

3.  **Apply database migrations:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

4.  **Create a superuser:**
    This will allow you to access the Django admin panel.
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    Follow the prompts to create your admin account.

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## API Documentation

The API is fully documented using Swagger and Redoc. Once the server is running, you can access the documentation at the following endpoints:
